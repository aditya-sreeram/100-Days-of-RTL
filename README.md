# 100 Days of RTL 

Welcome to my **100 Days of RTL** journey! In this repository, I’ll be documenting my progress as I explore and practice RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, focusing on Verilog/SystemVerilog concepts, coding techniques, and project-based learning.

## Repository Structure
- **/src**: Source files for each day’s code and projects.
- **/testbenches**: Testbenches for validating design functionality.
- **/docs**: Notes and reflections on daily progress.

## Follow Along
Feel free to follow this journey and connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/aditya-sreeram) or contribute by sharing insights, tips, or project ideas!

Thanks for visiting, and I hope this journey inspires others to dive into RTL design!
